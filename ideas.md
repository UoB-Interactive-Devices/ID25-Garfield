# Intial ideas
## Holographic sign language
A fan-based hologram with a camera, that the user interacts with via sign language. The hologram displays a character that signs back.
This could be used to teach sign langauge, offer companionship via a novel mode of interaction, and prove a differently accessible mode of HCI compared to voice recognition. Sign language is a 3d medium that is limited by being shown on 2d displays, and this project can help cirumvent that.

## Anthropomorphised plant
A set of sensors and output devices connected to a plant. These detect plant health and alert the owner in an unobtrusive and anthropomorphised manner. Since many people complain about not being able to keep a plant alive, this device leverages the emotional connection of an owner to promote the required habits, such as watering, trimming branches, etc.

## ARG pet
A pair of ARG glasses that project a modelled pet into the world of the user. This allows the user to interact with the pet via gestures, and the pet will respond.
