Sign Society paid for course. For beginners, but class was only 2 hours a week. Before some sign as guides, so satrted class knowing 1-2 sings and spelling. The teacher of the class was deaf, so sign was necessary. Since then no sign, so knowledge lost.

A lot of money (Â£300), sort of worth it but lack of continuation means the money was essentially wasted. 

Motivation lost because of Covid lockdown, and so a lack of interaction. If students had met online motivation will have been retained. 

App tried, but not very good. Not much development behind it, clunky to use. Many tools are behind paywalls, usually subscription. Sense does a subscription for sign language lessons via post. 

Paying for something would keep motivation. Presence of physical device would help with motivation too, as long as the cost is one time and relatively small. 

Facial expression is half the sign, and so the device must have a full range of facial expression. Expressions were important when learning, mostly because of mouthing words.
